# GarageStore

This project is a Garage Store web application, created with Java Enterprise technologies. 

On the backend side we use Spring framework for the API endpoints. 

Our frontend was made with React framework (React hooks), written in JSX. Styling was made with CSS3. 

We use Microservice Architecture to separete the application into smaller, independent, loosly coupled modules. 

To register the microservices, we have Eureka Server.

The gateway service is Zuul that provides dynamic routing and monitoring.
